Teabot is a cool little ruby program to read from a specified FlowDock room for commands and return their output. 

These commands can be shell commands the teabot can run and return the output of, or they can be teabot-specific!
Multiple teabots can listen to the same channel, and are called with their hostname in this case!

This program is great for build servers that need a ChatOps integration! You can start jobs or check their status all from the comfort of your FlowDock chat room!

More to come soon!
